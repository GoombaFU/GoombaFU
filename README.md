# Hello thereðŸ‘‹

My name is Adam, and I plan to go into the software engineering field when I graduate! I'm currently pursuing my B.S in computer science at Wright State University.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

## ðŸ”­ Projects I will be working on this semester
- Video Game
    - This is a martial arts / combat game where you refine your skills and take on gyms! (Think classic pokemon games, but with humans)

- Work Project
    - Currently working on a web app for my employer. This allows a customer to build a product to their liking!
